# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Overview
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a critical step in the data analysis process that involves summarizing the main characteristics of a dataset. This project demonstrates a detailed EDA  of  data on patients who underwent breast cancer surgery. The analysis includes various key EDA techniques, including data cleaning, visualization, and statistical analysis, using Python's data science libraries to uncover patterns and insights. 

The goal of this project is to provide insights and a clear understanding of the dataset, identify patterns, detect anomalies, and form hypotheses for further analysis.


## Features
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values, duplicates, and data type inconsistencies.
- **Descriptive Statistics**: Summarizing the data with measures like mean, median, standard deviation, and more.
- **Data Visualization**: Creating meaningful plots (e.g., histograms, scatter plots, box plots) to uncover trends and relationships.
- **Outlier Detection**: Identifying anomalies and understanding their impact on the dataset.
- **Correlation Analysis**: Examining relationships between variables to inform decision-making.


## Tools and Libraries Used
- **Python**
  - Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis
  - NumPy: Numerical computations
  - Matplotlib & Seaborn: Data visualization
  - Scipy & Statsmodels: Statistical analysis


## Dataset
The project uses a publicly available dataset. Ensure the dataset is accessible before running the code. If the dataset needs to be downloaded separately, include the link or source in the `data/` directory or reference it in the code.


## How to Use
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.7+
- Install required libraries by running:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

### Steps to Run
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ravix-Wiz/Exploratory-Data-Analysis.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Exploratory-Data-Analysis
   ```
3. Run the Jupyter Notebook or Python script:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook eda.ipynb
   ```
